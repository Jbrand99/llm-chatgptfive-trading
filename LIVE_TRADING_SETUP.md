# Live Trading Setup for AItradingWeb3.com

## Alternative Deployment Methods for Year-Round Operation

### Method 1: Always-On Repl with Custom Domain
Instead of using Replit Deployments, configure your Repl to run continuously:

1. **Enable Always-On Service**
   - Go to your Repl settings
   - Enable "Always On" feature
   - This keeps your Repl running 24/7 without deployments

2. **Custom Domain Configuration**
   - Add custom domain in Repl settings
   - Point AItradingWeb3.com to your Repl URL
   - Configure DNS A records

### Method 2: External VPS Deployment
Deploy to your own server with custom domain:

1. **Export Project Files**
   - Download entire project as ZIP
   - Transfer to VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

2. **Server Setup Commands**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js 20
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   
   # Install PM2 for process management
   npm install -g pm2
   
   # Setup project
   npm install
   npm run build
   
   # Start with PM2
   pm2 start npm --name "ai-trading" -- run start
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

3. **Domain Configuration**
   - Point AItradingWeb3.com A record to your VPS IP
   - Setup Nginx reverse proxy on port 80/443
   - Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt

### Method 3: Replit Always-On + Domain Forwarding
Use Replit's Always-On feature with domain forwarding:

1. **Enable Always-On in Repl Settings**
2. **Use Domain Forwarding Service**
   - Configure AItradingWeb3.com to forward to your Repl URL
   - Use services like Cloudflare or your domain registrar
   - Maintains custom branding while using Repl infrastructure

### Method 4: GitHub Pages + Replit Backend
Hybrid approach for maximum uptime:

1. **Frontend on GitHub Pages**
   - Deploy React frontend to GitHub Pages
   - Configure custom domain AItradingWeb3.com

2. **Backend on Always-On Repl**
   - Keep trading algorithms running on Repl
   - Frontend makes API calls to Repl backend
