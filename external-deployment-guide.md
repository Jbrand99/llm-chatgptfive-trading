# AItradingWeb3.com - External Deployment Guide

## Alternative Method: Domain Forwarding + Always-On Repl

Since you want to avoid Replit's deployment button, here's how to get your trading platform running at **AItradingWeb3.com** using external domain services:

### Step 1: Get Your Repl URL
Your current Repl is accessible at a URL like:
```
https://[repl-id].[username].repl.co
```

### Step 2: Purchase AItradingWeb3.com Domain
Purchase the domain from any registrar:
- GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains, etc.

### Step 3: Configure Domain Forwarding

#### Option A: Cloudflare (Recommended)
1. **Add Domain to Cloudflare**
   - Create free Cloudflare account
   - Add AItradingWeb3.com to your account
   - Update nameservers at your registrar

2. **Setup Page Rules**
   ```
   URL: AItradingWeb3.com/*
   Setting: Forwarding URL (301 - Permanent Redirect)
   Destination: https://[your-repl-url]/$1
   ```

3. **SSL Configuration**
   - Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
   - Set SSL mode to "Flexible"

#### Option B: Domain Registrar Forwarding
Most registrars offer URL forwarding:

**GoDaddy:**
1. Go to DNS Management
2. Add Forwarding record
3. Forward AItradingWeb3.com to your Repl URL

**Namecheap:**
1. Advanced DNS settings
2. Add URL Redirect Record
3. Set destination to your Repl URL

### Step 4: Enable Always-On (Alternative to Deployments)

Instead of using deployments, use Replit's "Always-On" feature:

1. **Go to Repl Settings** (not deployments)
2. **Enable "Always On"** feature 
3. **Configure environment variables** if needed
4. **Your Repl stays running 24/7**

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

Once configured:
- Visit https://AItradingWeb3.com
- Should redirect/forward to your trading platform
- All functionality preserved (trading bots, withdrawals, etc.)
